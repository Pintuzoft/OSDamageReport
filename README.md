OldSwedes Damage Report Plugin

Based on Gemeni's damage report, but have rewritten most of it and removed alot of stuff like commands and that popup thing.

The plugin will wait a moment after player death to include after death damage on other players, for example if the player 
holds on to a nade ready to let it go, gets killed and the nade does damage, that damage will now be included in the damage report

More information is now available where players can see damage taken/given on a specific hitbox group

Visability enhanced by making things shorter. The chat is very narrow in the game so to fit all information things has been 
more compacted.
